Description: This package contains functions that are useful for manipulating
    longitudinal data and for constructing data sets that can be
    used for population pharmacokinetic analysis with the program NONMEM.
    It is common for longitudinal data sets to be structured
    in blocks, with one or more 'ID' columns specifying block boundaries (i.e.
    resembling the format prescribed by NONMEM).  Manipulating data formatted
    this way can become cumbersome, and this package attempts to alleviate some of the
    burden by providing a set of standard functions, the 'blk.*' functions, to
    accomplish recurring operations.
